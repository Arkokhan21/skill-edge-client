                        <p className="mt-1 dark:text-gray-400">React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.</p>

                        <p className="mt-1 dark:text-gray-400">The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on.</p>

                        <p className="mt-1 dark:text-gray-400">The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders. It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated. It can be used to access a DOM element directly. useRef only returns one item. It returns an Object called current.</p>

                            React implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript. So when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will try to find the most efficient way to update the browserâ€™s DOM.
